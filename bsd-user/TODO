1. Look at reorganizing the .h mess
2. Look at strdup vs g_strdup
3. command line parsing mess
4. convert to qemu_log_mask or tracepoints.
5. Look at target_arch_reg.h and see if we can eliminate what looks like needless duplication.
6. better stack layout?

A decent short-term solution.

I'll draw your attention to my vdso patch set for linux-user:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20210706234932.356913-1-richard.henderson@linaro.org/

7. TARGET_SZSIGCODE cleanup
8. arm instruction emulation?
9. safe_* system call stuff for all system calls
10. Refactor really per-os
11. Look at automatic pointers for lock/unlock iovec
12. static inline junk
13. in do_bsd_readlink, need to revisit the test for
    "/proc/curproc/file" when on !FreeBSD
